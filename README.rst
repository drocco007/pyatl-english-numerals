    “tests help you *define and measure progress*, enable *exploration
    and creativity*, and give you the *confidence* to work quickly and
    efficiently”

My October talk was a spiritual successor to September's `Party Like
it's 500BC <https://github.com/pyatl/talks/tree/master/2014-09/roman>`_.
This month I emphasized the testing aspect of the development process
as we explored the creation of a solution from a mere problem statement
to a complete and well tested implementation.

Problem statement:

    | given a positive integer,
    | return its equivalent representation
    | in *English numerals*

The Source
----------

* `Implementation of the solution and commandline interface <english_number.py>`_
* `The py.test test suite for the implementation <test_english.py>`_

The `source code for the slides <english_number.rst>`_ includes doctests
for several of the intermediate steps in the construction process.
